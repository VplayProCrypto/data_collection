The focus is to support smaller pools of emerging tokens instead of fighting for liquidity within the top token pools.

Every time PIRE is transferred, the community receives dividends off the transfer. When someone decides to Exit the contract, another 15% of that is immediately shared to all users in the Community. With every Buy in, the price increments by 0.0000001 ETH and with every sell it decreases by the same factor, for everyone, without exception. Its truly decentralised.
