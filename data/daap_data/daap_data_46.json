Some planets are too cold, if their orbits are far from the main star of the system. On others, it is too hot, if the distance to the star is minimal. Nevertheless, the point is that any environment can be home to a particular form of life. The inhabitants of the ‘steam room’ planet and the planet-ocean will not be alike – that's for sure. However, each population take the laws of physics on the home planet as familiar and normal as earthlings take the fact that they need air for living, and for comfortable living the temperature at the Earth's surface should be 15 degrees Celsius.</p>\n<p>Today there is scientific evidence that the cosmic landscape design includes at least 10^500 habitable zones. This has worked out as inspiration for the galaxy of artists to create unique CosmoDoodle worlds.

However, there was a certain amount of consumerism in the new culture, and I decided to take an alternative ascetic approach of using 'nothing' to make music, rather than sink time and money into expensive hardware that many seemed to view as magical \"black boxes\". Nor did I want to upgrade my 10 year old laptop to be able to run the latest DAWs. I opted instead to rebuild from scratch, using only a cheap laptop running Linux, emacs text editor and a C compiler.

It also uses seigniorage created by its minting operations as transaction stimulus, thereby facilitating adoption. There is demand for a decentralized, price-stable money protocol in both fiat and blockchain economies.
